<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >For decades at MIT, dormitory communities have been developing sophisticated systems of self-governance.
These systems are entirely student-built and student-run, and they have received very little support or interference
from the MIT administration. Despite or because of this (you be the judge), these governance systems have
developed quite well.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >According to the MIT administration, Simmons Hall is intended to signal a change from the current standards of
dorm life. This is largely true. However, the governance of Simmons Hall will not be a change away from the
self-governance model, but formalization and strengthening of it. The Simmons Hall governance model is intended to
allow the dorm to have more independence and a stronger voice in the decisions that affect it. Moreover, it is
intended to better define the relationship of Housemasters and Graduate Resident Tutors to the governance process,
encouraging their participation and support but ensuring that they do not assume control over governance
functions.
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >The Simmons Hall governance model is also founded on the concept of the House as an entity that is more than
just a building and more than simply the sum of its residents. All residents are supported by the House physically
and socially. Reciprocally, the House requires support from all of its residents. This House model works on several
basic principles:
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >Principle 1: All residents have an implicit responsibility to the House. There is not a select group of people who
handle all the functions of House governance and whom you can blame if dorm life is not what you
want it to be. It is up to everyone. If you want Simmons Hall to be a good place, you have to get
involved and make it that way. If you think Simmons Hall sucks, then there&#8217;s no one you can blame but
yourself.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >Principle 2: There are varying levels of responsibility to choose from. You can run for an elected Office, or
volunteer to serve on a committee, or show up to House meetings, or on the most basic level, have respect for the
House and for your fellow residents.
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >Principle 3: The House speaks for the House. When the House makes a decision, it is explicit that the decision
was made through a democratic process that involves all House residents. There are no representatives who &#8220;call the
shots&#8221; for everyone.
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >Principle 4: If you do not like something, change it. While traditions are important to building culture, the
House should not keep doing something simply because people did it the year before, and other people did it the
year before that. Times keep changing and the House should keep thinking creatively and coming up with new ways
to improve House life.
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >Principle 5: House governance should be part of the educational experience for all residents. Students and faculty
alike should feel that they learned something from being an active member of the House. They should also feel that
they had some degree of fun and that their educational experience was better because they had a release from the
rigor of MIT academics and research.

<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >This is the philosophy behind the governance of Simmons Hall. <br

<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5x2">GENERAL DEFINITIONS
<ol  class="enumerate2" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7x1">Constitution of Simmons Hall
<ol  class="enumerate3" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-9x1">The purpose of the Constitution is: (a) to establish the overall model for governance of the
House; (b) to define the roles of some of the individuals and groups who are involved in
the governance of the House; (c) to define some of the procedures that guide the proper
functioning of House governance.
</li></ol>
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-11x2">The House
<ol  class="enumerate3" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-13x1">The House refers to the collective residents and communities residing within the Simmons
Hall dormitory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</li></ol>
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-15x3">House and Chair Policies
<ol  class="enumerate3" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-17x1">House and Chair Policies supplement the Constitution in guiding House governance, and may
be created and revised continually over time.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-19x2">House Policies may include, but are not limited to, policies on the use of House facilities and
House funds, rules of conduct such as quiet hours or regulations on the use of alcohol, policies
that establish the roles and responsibilities of new House governance groups or positions, and
policies that define or clarify House governance procedures.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-21x3">Chair Policies are determined by each current chair. These policies serve to clarify chairs&#8217;
roles and responsibilities as assigned by the constitution. They also serve to inform members
of the House of officers roles and responsibilities. The content of each chair&#8217;s policies can be
changed by said chair, however these changes must be announced at a House Meeting to take
effect. It is encouraged that a chair solicit house opinion before changing his or her policies.
</li></ol>

</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-23x3">THE HOUSE
<ol  class="enumerate2" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-25x1">Introduction
<ol  class="enumerate3" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-27x1">The House makes many decisions that impact all its residents. It raises funds to use towards
House-shared resources and events. The governance of Simmons Hall is established on the
principle that when an issue affects all residents, every resident should have a voice in making
a decision on that issue.
</li></ol>
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-29x2">House Membership
<ol  class="enumerate3" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-31x1">Every official resident of Simmons Hall is a member of the House. Each member may cast
one vote in any House decision.
</li></ol>

</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-33x3">Role and Responsibilities of the House
<ol  class="enumerate3" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-35x1">The House, by collective action, makes all major house-wide decisions and expresses the
official opinion of Simmons Hall on any matter of interest to the residents of Simmons Hall.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-37x2">The House is responsible for: (a) establishing House and Chair Policies, and making changes to
standing House Policies and the Constitution; (b) allocating House funds to be used towards
House-shared resources and events; (c) discussing and deciding upon any issue of relevance to
Simmons Hall or to MIT at large; (d) approving any resolution expressing the official opinion
of the residents of Simmons Hall on any such issue (e) electing House Officers to carry out
the will of the House.
</li></ol>
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-39x4">House Procedures
<ol  class="enumerate3" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-41x1">All official business of the House is discussed at meetings that are open and announced to all
members of the House and occur at least once within every two-week period during spring
and fall semesters that MIT classes are in session. House Officer meetings shall be held at
least a half an hour before general House meetings.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-43x2">Any House member may propose an item to be discussed or decided upon by the House by
submitting a proposal to the Chair of the House, who must place that item on the agenda of
the next House meeting if the agenda for that meeting has not been set.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-45x3">For all proposals brought before the House, four actions are available to the House: Approve,
Reject, Table, and Move-to-Full-Forum. The Chair of the House should remind participants
at the start of each semester that these options are available. Voting may take place during
meetings of the House or by ballot in the case of Move-to-Full-Forum. No item may be voted
upon until after it has been discussed at a House meeting.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-47x4">At least one author of the proposal must be present to advocate for it. Should no author
be present, the proposal shall be Tabled automatically, unless an author has presented the
House Chair an alternative advocate for the proposal in advance. Would the same proposal
be automatically tabled in this manner for the third consecutive time, it will instead be
automatically rejected to avoid cluttering the agenda with orphaned proposals.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-49x5">During debate on a proposal, motions may be raised. After a member of the House states
intention to raise a motion, another member must second the motion in order for it to have
any effect (i.e. &#8220;be raised&#8221;).
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-51x6">Proposals  may  be  approved  during  a  House  meeting  following  a  motion  to  vote.  Once
seconded, the House chair should direct and tally a vote, unless a motion to object is raised
and seconded. In such cases, the House should return to debate on the proposal. Proposals
are approved by a majority vote yes, with the exception that proposals for Constitutional
Amendments require a two-thirds majority vote for approval.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-53x7">In  the  case  where  those  assembled  feel  they  are  unanimously  in  favor  of  approving  the
proposal, a motion to white-ballot can be used. When a motion to white-ballot is raised,
the House chair should ask those assembled if any are opposed. If any member of the House
present is opposed, then the motion fails and the House returns to Debate. Once a motion to
white-ballot fails for a particular measure, no further motions to white-ballot may be raised

for that measure. A motion to white-ballot may not be used to approve a constitutional
amendment.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-55x8">A motion to force-vote may be used to counter the case when a vote cannot be held due
to frivolous objections. Once raised in the course of normal debate, a motion to force-vote
causes the House Chair to poll the support for a vote of those assembled. This vote cannot be
interrupted by a motion to object or any other motion. If the force-vote passes with majority
support then the meeting should proceed as if a motion to vote had been raised, with the
exception that no motions, including motions to object, may interrupt the vote. For each
proposal, no more than one motion to force-vote may be raised in any five minute period.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-57x9">Proposals  are  moved-to-full-forum  by  a  greater  than  one-third  vote  yes.  A  motion  to
move-to-full-forum takes precedence over a motion to approve but a motion to object can still
return the House to debate. When a proposal is moved-to-full-forum, the Secretary should
create a description of the issue of contention with input from one or more proponents and
opponents. The Secretary would then publicly post the description and issue a full house
ballot on the issue to be concluded before the next house meeting. The results of this vote
would be final.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-59x10">A motion to force-move-to-full-forum works like to a motion to force-vote with two exceptions.
First it requires only one-third support to proceed and second an uninterrupted motion to
move-to-full-forum, not a motion to vote, is the result. For each proposal, no more than one
such motion may be raised in any five minute period.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-61x11">Proposals are tabled by a majority vote. A motion to table takes precedence over a motion
to move-to-full-forum and a motion to approve but a motion to object can still return the
House to debate. When a proposal is tabled, it is moved to the next house meeting.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-63x12">A motion to force-table entails an immediate an uninterrupted vote on house support for
said motion. Should a majority agree with the motion, then an uninterrupted motion to table
should proceed. For each proposal, no more than one such motion may be raised in any five
minute period.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-65x13">For all the motions above, the fraction of votes required is to be taken as a fraction of those
electing to vote on the motion. Any members of the House who are not present or who choose
to abstain shall not be included in the count of the total number of votes.
</li></ol>

<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-207x1">Only undergraduate members of the House are eligible to serve as officers. No individual may
hold more than one office simultaneously, except in cases where an office remains unfilled for
an extended length of time.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-209x2">All elections must be open to all members of the House, whether or not they are able to
attend House meetings.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-211x3">The  election  process  is  overseen  by  the  Elections  Organizer.  By  default,  the  Elections
Organizer is the Chair of the House. However, if the Chair intends to be a candidate in the
election or otherwise wishes not to be Elections Organizer, the Chair must select another

undergraduate member of the House (who must not intend to be a candidate) to be the
Elections Organizer. This selection must be approved by a simple majority vote of the House.
The selection of Elections Organizer must occur before the beginning of nominations. The
Elections Organizer cannot be nominated to be a candidate. The Elections Organizer hears
all complaints related to the fairness of the election procedure.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-213x4">Nominations for officer positions will occur during the week preceding the elections House
meeting. A nominee will be placed on the ballot if their name is mentioned. People can
nominate themselves and nominate multiple times. One can be nominated by proxy. The
Chair must nominate anyone who notified him/her by two days before the House meeting.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-215x5">During the week before the announced election meeting and the final meeting of the term,
there is a special election meeting. During this meeting, all candidates will be given three
minutes to present their platform and one minute to answer questions. A further several
minutes will be dedicated to questioning any/all of the candidates for a particular office.
Proxies may read the platform of missing candidates, but may not take part in the question
answering sessions.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-217x6">New officers take office during the first meeting of the spring term. During the transition period
(the time between election results and the first spring House meeting), outgoing officers have
the responsibility of training the incoming officers and handing over turnover files. Outgoing
officers also have the responsibility of helping to run the first meeting of the spring term.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-219x7">An office becomes vacant when the individual holding that office resigns or is no longer an
official resident of Simmons Hall. An Officer may resign by informing the Chair of the House
of one&#8217;s resignation, or the Chair of the House may assume that an officer has resigned if that
officer fails to communicate with the House or otherwise fails to undertake the responsibilities
of that office.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-221x8">If a House Officer position becomes vacant mid-term, the resigning officer should be reminded
of his/her duty to train the replacement. The Chair of the House should notify the House
that the spot has become vacant and that they may demonstrate interest within the week. At
the end of the week, one of two outcomes has occurred: (a) 1 or 0 people have contacted the
chair. In this case, the chair is permitted to appoint said person (if one is found) to the office
in question. The Chair must ratify the selection at the next House meeting with a simple
majority vote; (b) 2 or more people have contacted the chair. In this case, the chair (with
the help of other officers) must administer a one-week mid-term election for the House to
select between the candidates. Additionally, if the end of the one-week special election would
fall within one month of the end of a regular election, then the House Chair may exercise
discretion in deciding whether to run a vote / appoint directly / wait for the main election.

responsibilities of that office; (b) the officer is abusing the authority granted to that office;
(c) the Officer is not acting in the interest of the House. A proposed Article of Impeachment
must include an explanation that addresses at least one of these three points.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-231x2">A proposed Article of Impeachment is placed on the House agenda, discussed, and voted upon
in the same manner as is any other item of House business.

House assumes the responsibilities of the Chair for all business relating to the Article of
Impeachment.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-235x4">If an Article of Impeachment is approved by a House vote, the Chair of the House holds a
hearing open to all members of the House. The proponent of the Article of Impeachment,
the object of the Article of Impeachment, and the Chair are given the opportunity to speak
at this hearing, and may invite witnesses to speak on their behalf, but any witness may be
dismissed by the Chair of the House on the grounds of irrelevance. No other individuals are
allowed to speak at this hearing.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-237x5">The Chair of the House may decide, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, to
remove an individual from office if and only if: (a) the information presented in the Article of
Impeachment is truthful in content; and (b) the Article of Impeachment sufficiently explains
why the impeached individual should be removed from office. After deliberation, the Chair
presents the decision, along with a written explanation, to the House.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-239x6">An office that is unoccupied as the result of impeachment proceedings is then treated in the

<ol  class="enumerate3" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-251x1">The  Simmons  Hall  Housemaster  team  consists  of  the  Housemasters  and  Associate
Housemasters, who are faculty members living with their families in Simmons Hall. The
Housemasters and Associate Housemasters are appointed to their positions by the Office of
the Dean for Student Life. They are expected to integrate fully into Simmons and to support
the entire dorm socially and intellectually.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-253x2">The Housemaster role in Simmons falls into four areas: (a) They hold frequent social events,
and participate actively in the social events held by House residents, in order to get to know
as many undergraduates as possible; (b) they help residents deal with problems, ranging from
inter-personal or inter-group issues to those of a highly personal and individual nature; (c)
they supervise the Graduate Resident Tutors; (d) they report to the rest of the MIT faculty
and to the MIT administration.
</li>
<li

<ol  class="enumerate3" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-259x1">Graduate Resident Tutors are MIT graduate students hired by the Office of the Dean for
Student Life to live in Simmons Hall, sometimes along with partners or families. They are
expected to integrate fully into the dorm and to provide support to a specific set of residents
living in a particular area of the building.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-261x2">The GRT role in the House falls into four areas: (a) They serve as advisors and mentors to
residents, particularly those living within their area; (b) they respond to crises and conflicts
that occur within the dorm, relying on their training and judgment; (c) they serve as advocates
for the interests of students, as liaisons between students and Housemasters, and sometimes
as liaisons between students and the administration; (d) they serve as community facilitators,
encouraging interaction and providing recreational opportunities for residents, particularly
those living within their area.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-263x3">The  GRT  role  in  the  dorm  expressly  excludes  any  disciplinary  component.  Only  the
Housemasters may officially recommend disciplinary action against a resident of Simmons
Hall.
</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-265x4">When new GRTs must be hired to fill open positions in Simmons Hall, a House committee
of House Officers and the Housemaster team is formed to review all candidates and provide

</li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-271x2">Individuals specially selected by an MIT authority to live in Simmons Hall, while Members
of the House, are not required to have any special responsibilities to the House. However,
the House may establish House Policies regarding the roles these individuals are expected to
play in the House. Live-in roles as defined by the House must complement, and must not

contradict, the roles as defined by the MIT authority responsible for appointing or hiring the
individuals.

the House, nor do they have any official standing with respect to the House, nor do they
